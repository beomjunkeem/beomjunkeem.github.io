I am a Graduate Researcher at [UCLA RoMeLa](https://www.romela.org/), advised by Prof. Dennis Hong. Previously, I worked as a Mechanical Design Engineer at Samsung Electronics, where I played a key role in the mechanical design and mass production of the [Galaxy Watch series](https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8-classic/). Bringing my industry experience in DFM (Design for Manufacturing) and precision engineering to robotics, I am currently researching humanoid hardware platforms, focusing on robotic hands and robotic skin.
