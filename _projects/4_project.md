I aimed to create my 3D printer, which could achieve a printing speed and acceleration three times faster than those available at Makerspace, specifically the Cubicon Single Plus. Not only was the Cubicon model notably slow and unstable, but it also came with a steep price tag of $4,000.

Voron (https://vorondesign.com/), an open-source project, offers instructions, a Bill of Materials, and software, enabling anyone to build their 3D printer at approximately $1,000. The model I constructed was the Voron 2.4 with a 350*350mm specification.
