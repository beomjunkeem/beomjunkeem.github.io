    An endoscope's sharp, rigid tip can scratch or puncture organs, and limited control flexibility leads to common problems in endoscopy, like looping or the walking-stick phenomenon. Doctors often spend about 70% of surgery time navigating the S-shaped sigmoid colon, which is exhausting and fraught with concerns.

To mitigate this, I devised a method to straighten the colon by inflating a soft robot (a double-layer overtube), forming a guiding tube. This allows the endoscope to pass through safely and quickly.

(1) The Continuum Insertion Device (CID) and the Double-Layer Soft Robot are combined to facilitate entry into the intestine.

(2) The double-layered soft tube, combined with the CID, is

inserted through an S-shaped colon.

(3) Air is supplied to Channel 1 to inflate the anchoring ring. This separates the CID and the double-layered soft tube and simultaneously fixes the double-layered soft tube to the colon.

(4) The CID is removed from the intestine.

(5) The thread is extracted.

(6) Air is supplied to Channel 2 to inflate the double-layered soft tube, expanding the intestine.

(7) The conventional endoscope is then inserted

The Double-Layer Soft Tube is made from polyethylene (PE), a material compatible with human organs, and easily fabricated using a heat sealer. Featuring unique holes, a thread keeps the robot flat, enabling it to inflate only upon user activation.
