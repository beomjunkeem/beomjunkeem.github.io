Makerspace produces substantial waste, like 3D printer filament scraps, unused MDF pieces from laser cutting, and other residues. This waste, if not appropriately managed, could pose environmental challenges.

Our solution involved grinding and breaking down these colorful wastes into small pieces, which we then encased in resin within a square box (sourced from discarded filament packaging) to create a plate.

    Once the plate hardened, we used a laser cutter to shape it into unique designs that could be assembled into speakers, clocks, and phone stands.
