    We identified touch and motion as intimate means of communication. Consequently, we developed a plant robot that conveys emotions using robotic arms, wheels, and LED faces and understands the user's context through ultrasonic, EMG, and moisture sensors. It responds to the user's greeting, shows anger if mistreated, appears affectionate when gently patted, and expresses sadness when the plant is too dry. This innovation brings joy to the interaction between humans and plants.
